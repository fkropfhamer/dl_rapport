\section{Introduction}
The target of this project is to create a deep learning framework.
The challenge is hereby to create a framework with only using basic tensor operations from pytorch.
Especially without the autograd function from pytorch.


\section{Architecture}
The architecture for the framework is split up into activation functions, error functions, layers and the sequential neural network itself.
There is a layer function which serves as a base class.
In base functionality it keeps track of the last input.

The fully connected class inherits from the base layer class.
It implements the forward and the backward function.
It also holds weights and a bias.
